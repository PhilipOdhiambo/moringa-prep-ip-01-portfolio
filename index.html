            <p>
               Currently I’m pursuing Software Design career path. I embarked on this path on realization that tech is the present and future, and that I have a part to play in the present and the future.I did my research and Moringa school came out prominent in my location – Nairobi Kenya.

            <p>
                I have over 10 years  work experience in Pharmaceutical sector, specifically in hospital pharmacy.During this time I have not only expanded career knowledge but I have experienced first hand the necessity of technology at the place of work. Consequently I have juggled up with tech to see how it  can help overcome my challenges. I am the tech champion at my place of work. I have also experience the need for collaboration in an organization without which the system cannot function.
            </p>

            <h3>Education Background</h3>

                <strong>Computers and Information Technology:</strong> This is a skill that has emerged from hobby.
